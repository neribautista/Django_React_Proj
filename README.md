# Django-React Project

#### An In-progress Full-Stack Web Application

This project combines **Django** as the backend and **React** as the frontend to create a modern web application. The goal is to integrate these two technologies to allow for smooth client-server interaction, utilizing Django's powerful backend capabilities with React's fast and responsive frontend framework.

---

## Project Overview

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
  - Used for creating REST APIs, handling database operations, user authentication, etc.
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
  - A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces, creating a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Secure token-based authentication for user login and session management.
- **Routing**: React Router (Frontend)
  - For navigating between pages in the React app.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from React to the Django backend.

---

## Features

- A fully functional backend built with Django, using the Django REST Framework (optional).
- A dynamic frontend built with React and Vite.
- Secure JWT-based authentication system.
- API integration between the React frontend and Django backend.
- Modular architecture allowing for easy expansion.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for React)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for React dependencies)
- **Python** (for Django)
- **pip** (for Python packages)
- **Django** (for backend setup)
- **Django REST Framework** (optional for APIs)
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** or any database of your choice (for Django)

### Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, you need to set up both the **frontend** and **backend** separately. You can find detailed setup instructions in their respective `README.md` files:

- **Frontend (React)**: Navigate to the `frontend/README.md` for detailed instructions on setting up and running the React application.
- **Backend (Django)**: Navigate to the `backend/README.md` for detailed instructions on setting up and running the Django backend application.

---

## Notes

- Ensure both **React frontend** and **Django backend** are running at the same time for full functionality.
- You may need to configure **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Django to allow the frontend and backend to communicate (e.g., using `django-cors-headers`).
- Don't forget to set up JWT-based authentication for secure user login and session handling.
- Update `settings.py` in Django for static files, allowed origins, and any other necessary configurations.
